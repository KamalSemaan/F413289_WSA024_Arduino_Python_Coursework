The objective is to create an **efficient and responsive system** that minimizes **energy consumption** while ensuring **effective memory management**.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **smart home environment** relies on a **temperature monitoring system** to regulate room temperature. The system uses a **temperature sensor** to collect real-time data, which is processed by an **Arduino-based controller**. The **CPU** decides whether to activate a **heater** based on temperature readings. This decision is crucial in maintaining a comfortable indoor environment while ensuring energy efficiency. However, if the system continuously samples temperature data at a high frequency, it results in excessive energy consumption. This is because the processor remains active, consuming power even when temperature fluctuations are minimal. Additionally, frequent sensor readings generate a large volume of data, increasing memory usage and slowing down processing. To address these inefficiencies, the system employs dynamic sampling adjustments, allowing it to switch between different power modes based on the rate of temperature change.\n",

        "\n",
        "It is important to approach this coursework methodically. A key learning outcome is to understand how to integrate hardware and software in an embedded system, as well as how to develop and optimize an existing system. This does not mean that you must fully understand every line of the provided Arduino code before starting, so do not feel overwhelmed.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, begin by setting up the Arduino hardware. The system consists of an Arduino board connected to a temperature sensor. You should familiarize yourself with the correct wiring configuration, ensuring that the sensor's **VCC**, **GND**, and **Data Pin** are connected properly to the Arduino. Make sure to verify that the connections are stable before proceeding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, study the provided C code that allows the Arduino to collect temperature readings. Identify key functions responsible for reading sensor data. Try modifying different parameters such as the sampling interval to observe how the system behaves. Work through this step interactively, compile the code, run it on the Arduino, and monitor the output in the serial console.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, analyze how the collected data is stored. The system logs temperature readings and outputs them directly to a file on the computer through the serial connection. This file will later be used for analysis in Python. You should understand how the Arduino writes data to the file and how Python will be used to process it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once data is collected, students will implement the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** in C to analyze the dominant temperature change frequencies. This analysis will allow the system to adjust the sampling rate dynamically, ensuring efficient energy use by detecting when high-frequency temperature variations occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, after gaining a good understanding of how the system operates, move on to the optimization task. The goal is to implement an adaptive sampling strategy to adjust the system’s power consumption based on temperature fluctuations. The more stable the temperature, the less frequent the readings should be. This ensures that the system runs efficiently without unnecessary energy waste.\n",
        "\n",
        "Approach this coursework iteratively, test your implementation, analyze the results, and refine your design as needed. By doing so, you will develop both a theoretical and practical understanding of embedded system optimization.\n",

        "\n",
        "The temperature monitoring system acts as an intelligent **environmental regulator**, which continuously assesses temperature fluctuations to determine the optimal response. It operates using an **adaptive control mechanism**, adjusting its **sampling rate and power mode** dynamically to balance energy efficiency and data accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **sampling rate** defines how often temperature data is collected. If a fixed high **sampling rate** is used, it leads to **unnecessary energy consumption and excessive data storage**. **Sampling Frequency** refers to the number of samples taken per second when measuring a signal, which is expressed in Hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz = 1 sample per second. For example: If a system samples temperature data at 10 Hz, it means 10 temperature readings are taken every second.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system features **three operating modes**, each designed to optimize energy use and performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Active Mode**: The system enters this mode when **rapid temperature fluctuations** are detected. In this state, the **sampling frequency is high**, allowing for quick responses to environmental changes. This ensures that the system can react promptly, such as turning on a heater when a sudden drop in temperature occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Idle Mode**: When **temperature fluctuations are minor**, the system reduces its sampling frequency to a moderate level. This prevents unnecessary power consumption while still maintaining sufficient responsiveness to gradual temperature changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Power Down Mode**: If the temperature remains **stable** over an extended period, the system further reduces its sampling frequency to the lowest level. This significantly **minimizes power consumption**, allowing the system to run efficiently without excessive data logging or energy waste.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is an **example** of the three modes, each with a different sampling frequency. The amount of stored temperature data depends on how often the system logs temperature readings.\n",

        "- Switching between modes **reduces unnecessary logging**, ensuring **only important temperature variations** are recorded.\n",
        "\n",
        "These **three modes** allow the system to intelligently allocate resources, ensuring that energy is used only when necessary while still capturing relevant environmental data. The transition between modes is governed by **real-time analysis** of temperature trends, ensuring an efficient and adaptive monitoring process. To optimize energy efficiency, this coursework focuses on **dynamic sampling rate adjustments** based on temperature fluctuations."

        "# **Task 4: Adaptive Sampling Rate Optimization (35 marks)**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this task, students will develop an intelligent temperature monitoring system that dynamically adjusts its sampling rate and power mode based on real-time temperature variations. The system will progressively transition between three power modes: Active Mode, Idle Mode, and Power Down Mode to optimize energy consumption while ensuring accurate temperature tracking. The key challenge is to implement a two-stage decision process that determines both the appropriate power mode and the optimal sampling rate based on temperature trends and frequency analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a scenario that the room temperature changes dynamically due to external factors (heater, air conditioner, or human influence).  \n",
        "Instead of using a fixed sampling rate in Task 3 and Table 1, your system should adjust its sampling rate dynamically based on observed temperature fluctuations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system starts by collecting temperature data for one minute (one cycle) at an initial sampling rate (the students have the freedom to select the initial sampling rate). The collected data is then analyzed to determine whether temperature fluctuations are significant. This is done by computing the total difference between consecutive samples to assess how much the temperature changes over time. If the variation remains within a small predefined threshold (again, in the design, students need to define the threshold value based on their collected temperature data), the system switches to Idle Mode to reduce power consumption. If Idle Mode persists for five consecutive cycles, indicating long-term stability, the system enters Power Down Mode to further conserve energy. However, if a sudden temperature fluctuation occurs at any stage, the system immediately reactivates Active Mode to ensure accurate monitoring.  Additionally, Discrete Fourier Transform analysis is used to detect dominant frequency components, dynamically adjusting the sampling rate based on real-time temperature trends. This adaptive strategy prevents unnecessary high-frequency sampling when the environment remains stable, while ensuring quick responsiveness to sudden changes, ultimately balancing accuracy and power efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "To further refine the decision-making process, DFT extracts dominant frequency components from the temperature variations. By transforming the data into the frequency domain, the system can identify periodic patterns in temperature changes. The DC component (k = 0), representing the overall average temperature, should be ignored, and only frequency components relevant to temperature fluctuations should be considered. The dominant frequency will be used as a reference to adjust the sampling rate dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the system determines whether to operate in Active, Idle, or Power Down Mode, the sampling rate must be adjusted dynamically. The dominant frequency extracted from apply_dft() in your Task 3 should be rewrite to guide this adjustment. The sampling rate must be at least twice the dominant frequency to satisfy **Nyquist’s sampling theorem** and avoid data loss. For instance, if the dominant frequency is 1.8 Hz, the sampling rate should be 3.6 Hz or higher. However, if temperature variations remain stable, the sampling rate should gradually decrease to minimize energy usage. The system must ensure the sampling rate remains within a predefined range, such as between 0.5 Hz and 4.0 Hz, to maintain efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "A future temperature variation trend must also be predicted using a moving average method. Students should track temperature variation trends over the last 5 to 10 monitoring cycles and compute a moving average based on the last 10 temperature differences. This prediction helps determine whether temperature fluctuations are increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable, which directly influences the choice of power mode. If the predicted variation is large, the system remains in Active Mode; if it is moderate, the system enters Idle Mode. If temperature fluctuations stay consistently low for five consecutive cycles, the system transitions into Power Down Mode to further conserve energy.
